##Written using markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

###March 17, 2021
Completed Git-it tutorial for the third time, this time completely successfully. This whole time, I didn’t realize that I had to make a pull request through the Github website instead of through the terminal somehow, since a pull request is a Github thing, not a Git thing!

Set up a Github Pages website daniel-chuang.github.io. I’m gonna include my programming journal on there.
