# Programming Journal
#### March 18, 2021
Filled out the Git-it related questions for the Beaverworks course.

Started the visual Git branches guide for Beaverworks: [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

Read ["Code"](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOK2/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Code&qid=1616050791&s=books&sr=1-2) up to the chapter on subtractions. I learned about how you can use the complement of a number in order to perform subtractions computationally without even borrowing! I want to make a simple binary redstone calculator in Minecraft to practice what I learned.

I also saw a cool YouTube video about how you can speed read if the text appears in front of you and you must keep up. Apparently, on average people read 300 wpm, but with a blinking word system, you can read even faster. I looked a bit more into it and apparently it's called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. There are website for it such as this [one](https://accelareader.com/). It might be fun to try to build one of my own, to practice how to do something with a simple text input!

Completed the Git-it tutorial for the third time, this time successfully. This whole time, I didn’t realize that I had to make a pull request through the Github website instead of through the terminal somehow, since a pull request is a Github thing, not a Git thing!

Set up a Github Pages website. I’m gonna include this programming journal on there. I also learned about how to set up a Github Pages website as well as how to write markdown files for it.

Gained some familiarity with terminal usage. In specific, I learned about swapping users (su) and using the super user (sudo). Also learned about deleting files and stuff with (rm).

Spent some time learning how to potentially make an app using Kodika.io, which I found on the Github Student pack. The interface and concept behind the app is really nice, but it gets super annoying to use "constraints" to try to keep sizing consistent with different device screen sizes. I did this in order to see if I could potentially make an app for the [Avenues Investor Publication](https://www.avenues.finance).
