# Tetris A.I Process Journal
#### March 15 - March 22
##### To-do List:
- [ ] Learn About OpenCV and Image Recognition
- [ ] Complete some type of image recognition basic program by end of week.
- [ ] Learn About Programs interacting with games through GUI.
- [ ] Make some type of GUI automated random gameplay.
- [ ] If time allows: learn about AI.

##### Notes:
I didn't complete any of the above, because I ended up taking a very different course of learning! I learned how to version projects using Git (Command Line Interface, because it's cooler) and Github. Here are three deliverables to prove that I did that:

###### Github Pages Website
You are currently on a website that I made using Github Pages and version control! I will constantly be using the concepts that I learned about version control not only for my actual project but also for this process journal. Therefore, this website is another example of my learning in source control that will continue to evolve as I progress in my project.
