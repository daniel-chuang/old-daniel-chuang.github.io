# Tetris A.I Process Journal
#### March 15 - March 22
##### To-do List:
- [ ] Learn About OpenCV and Image Recognition
- [ ] Complete some type of image recognition basic program by end of week.
- [ ] Learn About Programs interacting with games through GUI.
- [ ] Make some type of GUI automated random gameplay.
- [ ] If time allows: learn about AI.

##### Notes:
I didn't complete any of the above, because I ended up taking a very different course of learning! I learned how to version projects using Git (Command Line Interface, because it's cooler) and Github. Here are three deliverables to prove that I did that:
